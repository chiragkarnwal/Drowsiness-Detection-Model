# Drowsiness-Detection-Model

Hey thereðŸ‘‹, Today i have created this model for drowsiness alertion. Basically what it does that using the OpenCv library and YOLO algorithm for object detection it detects the motion of the eyes and whenever it enounters the blink it'll start alarming.

Hope y'a like it!:)
